The Basic Rules of Mancala

This is a version of the basic game, known as two-rank Mancala, or Kalah. There are literally dozens of other variations of the game which are played all around the world.

The Object of the Game

The object of the game is to capture more stones than your opponent.

How to Play

The Mancala board is made up of two rows of six holes, or pits, each. If you don't have a Mancala board handy, substitute an empty egg carton.

Four pieces—marbles, chips, or stones—are placed in each of the 12 holes. The color of the pieces is irrelevant.

Each player has a store (called a Mancala) to the right side of the Mancala board. Cereal bowls work well for this purpose if you're using an egg carton.

The game begins with one player picking up all of the pieces in any one of the holes on thier side.

Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the stones in each hole until the stones run out.

If you run into your own store, deposit one piece in it. If you run into your opponent's store, skip it.

If the last piece you drop is in your own store, you get a free turn.

If the last piece you drop is in an empty hole on your side, you capture that piece and any pieces in the hole directly opposite.

Always place all captured pieces in your store.

The game ends when all six spaces on one side of the Mancala board are empty.

The player who still has pieces on his side of the board when the game ends capture all of those pieces.

Count all the pieces in each store. The winner is the player with the most pieces.
